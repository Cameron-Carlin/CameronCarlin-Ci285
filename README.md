SETUP
In order to use the Calculator, Clone the repository to your favoured location.

Once extracted, open the terminal and use ls to bring up a list of available folders.

Use command $cd Calculator to enter the application folder.

Once inside, run $stack build && stack exec Calculator.

This should set up the Calculator to run on Localhost:3000

You now have the option to click on each function (With predefined values just to show it works). These can be changed in
the URL of the function that has been selected.

You may also type into your searchbar "localhost:3000/fun/x/y" . This will allow you to directly input the function and values you wish to use.

List of fun: add, sub, mul, div (Input values x & y have to be integers).
